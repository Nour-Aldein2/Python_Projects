This is a description of the projects of each file in this repository. If there is a need to write more descriptions, there will be an individual read.me file for that project.

1- BMI: as the name suggests, is a python calculator to find the body mass 
index.

2- Rock-Paper-Scissors: is the popular game rock paper scissors where you 
play against the computer.

3- Password Generator: It asks for how hard you want it to be, then 
generate one using the random module. 

4- Hangman: A game that could be used in English lessons. The main idea is to guess a word letter by letter before the drawing of the hungman is completed. `hangman_word.py` has the list of words that `main.py` will choose from randomly, while `hangman_art.py` has the ascii art used in this game.

5- Caesar Cipher: In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence (see more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)). The code file in this repasitory can encrypt or decrypt a text based on a shift rule decided by the user.
