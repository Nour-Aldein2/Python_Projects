This is a description of the projects of each file in this repository. If there is a need to write more descriptions, there will be an individual read.me file for that project.

1- BMI: as the name suggests, is a python calculator to find the body mass 
index.

2- Rock-Paper-Scissors: is the popular game rock paper scissors where you 
play against the computer.

3- Password Generator: It asks for how hard you want it to be, then 
generate one using the random module. 

4- Hangman: A game that could be used in English lessons. The main idea is to guess a word letter by letter before the drawing of the hungman is completed. `hangman_word.py` has the list of words that `main.py` will choose from randomly, while `hangman_art.py` has the ascii art used in this game.
